    <h1>Project-1 Proposal</h1>

    <h3>What is your website about?</h3>
    <p>
      My website will be aiming to provide information about sailing boat
      chartering in Turkey. It will aim on customers to view the availability
      dates without contacting a representative, see the prices, information of our company and our boat, and
      policies.
    </p>

    <h3>What is the objective of your website?</h3>

    <p>
      The main objective will be to inform customers for our policies, pricing
      information, and availability throughout seasons. This website is vital
      because our customers would like to have a site where they would like to
      read our policies and view our contact information alongside with our
      pricing criteria.
    </p>

    <h3>Who is your target audience set?</h3>

    <p>
      My target audience is everyone between 30â€“75-year-old people who are
      looking to have a safe vacation with their families, away from crowded
      areas and covid-19.
    </p>

    <h3>What content do you plan to include in each page of your website?</h3>
    <p>
      Other than the homepage, I was planning on: Pricing, Contact,
      Availability, Policies, Famous Locations for sailing, a page with
      Instagram API where it draws live feed.
